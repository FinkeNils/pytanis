# The Review Process

On a high-level, the review process of the proposals for a conference works like that:
1. finding external reviewers and learning about their preferences,
2. onboarding reviewers in [Pretalx],
3. assign proposals to reviewers according to their preferences,
4. communicate with the reviewers occasionally for updates,
5. track the whole process.

## Finding external Reviewers and learning about their preferences

For the PyConDE / PyData Berlin 2023, we were looking for about 50 external reviewers since we expected about 400
proposals, and we wanted to have 3 reviews per proposal. This would about to 25 proposals to review per person and still
manageable within a few weeks if you schedule 5-15 minutes per proposal.

To get external reviewers, we would only ask within our circle of trust and refer them to some [Google Forms]. This
basically consisted of following questions with descriptions:

* **Name** \[short answer\]: Please write your name starting with your first name, e.g. Albert Einstein.
* **Affiliation** \[short answer\]: Please state the name or organisation you are affiliated with.
* **Who do you know from the Committee?** \[short answer\]: We believe in the ring of trust model. With this question, we really only
  want to make sure that not random people sign up with no connection to any member of the Program Committee at all.
* **Availability during the Review Period** \[checkboxes]: The bulk of the review work will take place from January 5th to February
  13th, 2023, so it is important that you are broadly available during this period. That being said, you will be quite
  flexible in managing your time but being on vacation with no internet for 3 weeks might be suboptimal here ;-)
  *There was only one mandatory checkbox: Yes, I am broadly available during this period.*
* **Additional comments regarding your availability during the review period.** \[long answer\]
* **Topics you want to review**: These are the topics you are interested in reviewing. The more you select the better.
  Don't be shy, you don't have to be an expert in a topic to review a proposal. If you are interested in a topic and
  have some knowledge about it, you are totally up for the job :-)
  *Each track in Pretalx corresponded to one checkbox in this form. At least 5 preferences needed to be chosen.*
* **Do you want your name to be listed as a reviewer on the conference website?** \[checkbox\] *Mandatory yes/no checkboxes*
* **Any additional comments for the Program Committee** \[long answer\]

!!! tip
    [Google Form] will use the separator `, ` (comma, whitespace) for the selected checkboxes. Having the same separator
    in your track name, e.g. "General: Community, Diversity, Career, Life and everything else", will make it a bit harder
    to parse the resulting [Google Sheet]. So it's better to avoid them in track names.

Every submission of the Google Form is then automatically added to a Google Sheet, which can be easily read with the
help of Pytanis.

## Onboarding Reviewers in Pretalx




**Under Construction**


* Mention the Pretalx feature request https://github.com/pretalx/pretalx/issues/1417, mention that username should be unique until then
* add question to the Form if user want additional proposals for review once their batch is done....
